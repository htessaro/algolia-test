Visual KPI Remote Context Services (RCS) is a set of interfaces and queries that enable reading metadata or configuring information from various business applications or sources of contextual information. Visual KPI then uses this information to create and configure objects in the system.

To learn all about Visual KPI RCS check the following links:

<LinkCards numColumns={2} data={
  [
    {
      name: 'Core Concepts',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/automation/rcs'
    },
    {
      name: 'Configuration',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/automation/rcs-configuration'
    },
  ]
}/>
