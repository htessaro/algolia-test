By default, Visual KPI sites have a white background; this is the light theme. But you can add a dark theme to cut down on-screen glare for use in environments where a black background would make more sense. Your admin can fully customize how the status of your KPIs appears in light and dark themes, selecting colors for each theme and each status.
